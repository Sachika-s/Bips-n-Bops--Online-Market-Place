A full-stack multi-vendor e-commerce platform built with Next.js 15, Payload CMS, Stripe Connect, and TailwindCSS. The application allows creators to launch their own customizable storefronts, sell digital products, and securely process payments with automatic platform fees. It includes vendor subdomains, product reviews, user purchase libraries with file delivery, and role-based access control for both admin and merchant dashboards. Additional features such as search, category filtering, image uploads, and a modern UI powered by ShadcnUI make it a comprehensive and scalable solution that mirrors the functionality of real-world digital commerce platforms.
